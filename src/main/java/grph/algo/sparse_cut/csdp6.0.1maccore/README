This directory includes a binary version of CSDP for Mac's with Intel
Core Duo or Core 2 Duo processors.  Note that because gcc 4.2 is not
yet standard in Mac OS X, this code has not been compiled with OpenMP
and is thus not properly optimized to use multiple processors- rather,
it simply uses Apple's BLAS/LAPACK libraries and is parallelized only to
the extent that these libraries are parallelized.
 
The directories are as follows:

  doc                  documentation.

  matlab               MATLAB routines for interfacing to CSDP.  

  bin                  Executable version of csdp.

Installation:  Copy csdp from the bin directory into a directory that
is in your search path.  If you want to use the MATLAB interface, copy the
contents of the MATLAB directory into a directory that is in your MATLAB
search path.
